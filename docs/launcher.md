When you first open benny a couple of windows should appear:

## The benny launcher window

This is where you access various settings and config options - there are buttons to launch the audio settings, the vst manager and the hardware editor. The dropdown let you pick the hardware setup you're using, and the start button starts benny.

## The max/msp console window

This is the max/msp console window. benny prints information about what's going on here. if something goes wrong, there may well be useful messages here explaining what and why.

If the console isn't visible when you start benny, select the benny launcher and press ctrl-shift-M to bring it up.

Additionally the 'project' window sometimes (randomly) opens. You can just close this.
