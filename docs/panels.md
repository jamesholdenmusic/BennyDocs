The panels page of benny is a place to build a set of controls and visualisations to help play the song.

Every block can have a panel. The panel can show whichever of the block's parameters you choose. (Look for 'panel assign' in the **block settings** section of the [sidebar](sidebar.md#panel-assign)).

Panels also show the states stored for a block.

If a block has a mini-ui view the panel will show this too.

If you ctrl-click the panels button in the top bar benny enters the panels edit mode, where you can move panels up and down in order and remove unwanted ones.
