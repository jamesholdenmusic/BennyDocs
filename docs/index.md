benny is a modular software playground for making live music

it seamlessly integrates hardware and software, midi and audio, lets you connect anything to anything and extends into polyphony elegantly

benny is an extendible and hackable place to host your own max/msp patches

other key ideas behind benny are that it provides a minimal, low distraction interface that's easy to glance at (eg while performing) and that it tries to avoid imposing any hierarchical decisions on the user (eg it has no global timeline, no pre-defined mixer structure, etc)
