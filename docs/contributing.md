- If you're not sure, start by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions) instead.
### Fix bugs

- Fix the bug in your branch.
- Submit a pull request to have your fix merged back into the main repository.
- Any questions or doubts, start a [discussion](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions).
### Contribute blocks
- It's very easy to make blocks. If you make something good and want it to be part of the public repository you are welcome to submit it. You can name your blocks with your own prefix if you want and that prefix will be given its own section of the blocks menu.
- Create a new branch, commit your block files to it, submit a pull request.
### Contribute VST plugin setup files
- benny comes with a library of VST plugin config files so it can work out the box with those ones. If you make a config file for a VST plugin that wasn't included, please submit it to the library via the [forum](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions) or pull request. 
### Help with this manual

## Acknowledgements

benny relies on several other people's work.

- [Cycling74](https://www.cycling74.com) who build max/msp and generously let it run as a free runtime environment.
- [Chris Airwindows](https://www.airwindows.com) whose open source code is an excellent learning resource and also used in various benny blocks.
- [Isabelgk](https://github.com/isabelgk/airfx) for porting the airwindows vsts into native max externals.
- [Surreal Machines](https://www.surrealmachines.com/) whose gen filter models are used in a few places in the provided audio blocks.
- [Ernest Meyer](https://www.yofiel.com) whose advanced max + gen tutorials on the c74 forums were instrumental in working out benny's efficient modulation routing system, and whose EPTR oscillator code is used in various places to provide very clean rectangle waves (which are integrated to provide very clean triangle and saw waves too).
- Michael Terren as I found [this](https://disclaimer.org.au/contents/where-and-how-to-gather/the-hegemony-of-the-daw) essay and others inspirational.
- [Oskari Tamellin](http://jeskola.net/) who wrote [Jeskola Buzz](http://jeskola.net/buzz/), the first music software I ever used and a huge inspiration for benny's design.
