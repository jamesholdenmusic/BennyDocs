[https://www.jamesholden.org/](I) made benny because it didn't exist and I wanted it. It's my personal project and designed around my ideas and priorities. This makes it a different kind of thing to commercial software.

Benny is free to download and use. It is also open source and you're free to use the code provided in other projects, as long as those projects also come with the same license terms as benny.

You are very welcome to contribute to benny.

- report bugs
    - create a new bug report [https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/benny/issues](here)
    - a good bug report contains a clear description of the problem and steps or attached files to reliably reproduce it
    - in many cases, benny prints useful information to the max console. this may not be visible on your computer, but should come up if you press ctrl-shift-m while on the benny launcher window.
    - if you're not sure, start by opening a [https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/benny/discussions](discussion) instead
- fix bugs
    - create a new branch of the repository
    - fix the bug in your branch
    - submit a pull request to have your fix merged back into the main repo
    - any questions or doubts, start a [https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/benny/discussions](discussion)
- contribute blocks
    - it's very easy to make blocks. if you make something good and want it to be part of the public repo you're welcome.
    - create a new branch, add your block, submit a pull request
- contribute to documentation
    - this documentation is a [https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/BennyDocs](separate github repository). if you hit a problem or question that isn't answered here please do add the solution when you find it to the docs, in a logical place.
- donate
    - if you're unwaged or otherwise economically disadvantaged please do not donate
    - otherwise, donations will increase the amount of time I can spend on benny, and may be used in part to pay other people to implement things that are beyond my skill level. I'm not offering any guarantees or promises here - I have another job that I also really like.
