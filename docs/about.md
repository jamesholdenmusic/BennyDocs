[I](https://www.jamesholden.org/) made benny because it didn't exist and I wanted it. It's my personal project and designed around my ideas and priorities. It's not commercial software. I've been using benny for my live sets since early 2023.

Benny is free to download and use. It is also open source and you're free to use the code provided in other projects, as long as those projects also come with the same license terms as benny. 

You are very welcome to contribute to benny according to your means and abilities.

### Report bugs
- create a new bug report [here](https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/benny/issues)
- a good bug report contains a clear description of the problem and steps or attached files to reliably reproduce it
- in many cases, benny prints useful information to the max console. this may not be visible on your computer, but should come up if you press ctrl-shift-m while on the benny launcher window.
- if you're not sure, start by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/benny/discussions) instead
### Fix bugs
- create a new branch of the repository
- fix the bug in your branch
- submit a pull request to have your fix merged back into the main repo
- any questions or doubts, start a [discussion](https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/benny/discussions)
### Contribute blocks
- it's very easy to make blocks. if you make something good and want it to be part of the public repo you're welcome. you can name your blocks with your own prefix if you want and that prefix will be given its own section of the blocks menu.
- create a new branch, commit your block files to it, submit a pull request
### Help with documentation
- this documentation is a [separate github repository](https://github.com/jamesholdenmusic/BennyDocs). if you hit a problem or question that isn't answered here please do add the solution when you find it to the docs, in a logical place.
### Donate
- [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=PBQ7JWRPJKLWQ)
- if you're unwaged or otherwise economically disadvantaged please do not donate
- otherwise, donations will increase the amount of time I can spend on benny, and may be partly used to pay other people to implement things that are beyond my abilities. 

## Acknowledgements

benny relies on several other people's work.

- [cycling74](https://www.cycling74.com) who build max/msp and generously let it run as a free runtime environment.
- [chris airwindows](https://www.airwindows.com) whose open source code is both an excellent learning resource but also used widely in various benny blocks.
- [isabelgk](https://github.com/isabelgk/airfx) for porting the airwindows vsts into native max externals
- [ernest meyer](https://www.yofiel.com) whose advanced max + gen tutorials on the c74 forums were instrumental in working out benny's efficient modulation routing system.
- [oskari tamellin](http://jeskola.net/buzz/) jeskola buzz (as well as being the software that I got my start in music on) was a big inspiration for benny's design.
