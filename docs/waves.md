benny keeps all the waves you use in a centralised repository that all blocks share access to. In the waves page you can load in waves and tag them with timing information.

*This page of benny is one of the less finished areas. The UI is a bit awkward still and many planned features are not yet implemented.
*

## Load a wave

Click an empty slot and a file chooser dialog will pop up to let you choose a wave. It'll load up and a pictoral representation of it will appear.

You can use the scroll wheel to zoom on the wave.

## Slices

*In the future benny will support automatic marker placement and flexible grids.*

At the moment you can only put a fixed grid of slices on your waves. This is essential for blocks like wave.scan and voice.multisample which use the slices. 

Use the sliders to position the start and end of the grid and choose how many slices there are. Alt+shift + scroll for fine adjust.
